# Trained image classification models for Keras using VGG16 and Resnet50 models

This repository contains code for the following Keras models:

- Resnet50
- VGG19

Pre-trained weights can be automatically loaded upon instantiation (`weights='imagenet'` argument in model constructor for all image models. Weights are automatically downloaded if necessary, and cached locally in `~/.keras/models/`.
